# Chopsticks's Weekly Report

## Project Goals:)! & Deadlines :(!
By Feb 18 PR1, we need to
1. Cast the liver (with blood pigment) and the stomach (can be colorless)
2. Complete CAD Design of the platform
3. Complete Blaser 3D point cloud generation (in simulation?)

## 1.Build the final Physical Model - updatad by Cora - Feb 3
Already Done:  
1. Reprint Part 2 of the cast model of the liver (Part 1 isn't broken)  

Need To Do:
1. Redesign the CAD model of the liver
2. Redesign Part 3 of the cast model of the liver (The current one is hard to print)  
3. Reprint the Part 2 of the cast model of the tumor (Some one stole it!)   
4. Recast the model  
5. Test the blood pigment
6. Design CAD model of Blaser holder

## 2. Complete CAD/PCB Design of the platform - Alex!Please update here!
Already Done:  
Need To Do: 
1. Fit the new motors on the moving platform and finish the software part
2. Test the blood pigment
3. Design CAD model for Blaser holder

## 3.1 PCL generation - Blaser Part - updated by Cora & Anjali - Feb 3  
Already Done:  
1. Figure out the software pipeline of transform 3D pt Cloud (No code sad)  
  
Need To Do:
1. Write a ROStf listener to read the tf tree of dvrk robot  
2. Use Blaser Registration (or manually measure) compute the transform matrix between blaser and the end effector  
3. Add Blaser to the tf trees and test the stiching pcl code from blaser team  
  
## 3.1 PCL generation - Control Part - Chang & Arti! please update here!  
Already Done:  
Need To Do:  
1. camera-robot registration : Arti
2. Scanning motion dvrk : Chang & Arti
