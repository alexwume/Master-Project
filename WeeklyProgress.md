# Chopsticks's Weekly Report

## Project Goals:)! & Deadlines :(!
By Feb 18 PR1, we need to
1. Build the final Physical Model
2. Complete CAD /PCB Design of the platform
3. Complete Blaser 3D point cloud generation

## 1.Build the final Physical Model - updatad by Cora - Feb 3
Already Done:  
1. Reprint Part 2 of the cast model of the liver (Part 1 isn't broken)  

Need To Do:
1. Redesign Part 3 of the cast model of the liver (The current one is hard to print)  
2. Reprint the Part 2 of the cast model of the tumor (Some one stole it!)   
3. Recast the model  

## 2. Complete CAD/PCB Design of the platform - Alex!Please update here!
Already Done:  
Need To Do:  

## 3.1 PCL generation - Blaser Part - updated by Cora & Anjali - Feb 3  
Already Done:  
1. Figure out the software pipeline of transform 3D pt Cloud (No code sad)  
  
Need To Do:
1. Write a ROStf listener to read the tf tree of dvrk robot  
2. Use Blaser Registration (or manually measure) compute the transform matrix between blaser and the end effector  
3. Add Blaser to the tf trees and test the stiching pcl code from blaser team  
  
## 3.1 PCL generation - Control Part - Chang & Arti! please update here!
